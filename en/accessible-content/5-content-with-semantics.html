<h2> Baking pancakes </h2>
    <p> Sift the flour with the salt over a large mixing bowl.
       Add the eggs and half of the milk and beat with a whisk until smooth.
       Pour in the rest of the milk and beat again.
       Cover the bowl with cling film and let the batter stand for 30 minutes.
       Heat a knob of butter in a 20 cm diameter frying pan and add a tablespoon of batter.
       Turn the pan around so that the entire bottom is covered.
