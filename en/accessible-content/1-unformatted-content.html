        <p>Different ways of reading.</p>

        <p>Not everyone has the same reading level. How do you ensure that as many people as possible understand your text and find the information they need? Because of course you want as many visitors as possible to find what they are looking for.
           This chapter addresses:
           What type of readers are there?
           Which ways of reading are there?
           What problems do readers encounter?
           Why is structure so important?
           Everyone is different, you can't put readers in a box with a label on it: you read that way. But there are similarities between different groups of readers and whatâ€™s important to them.
           Structuring and formatting text and adding images can make a world of difference in clarity and usability.
