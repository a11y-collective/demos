    <h2>Too long</h2>

    <p>The average visitor doesn't read on your website, but scans. Jumps from head to link to enumeration to button while searching. Looking for guidance: where is the information I am looking for?
       The reader visits your website with a mission: What is your telephone number, how much does that special headset cost, what are the shipping costs for abroad. Only when the requested information is found the visitor really starts reading. An accessible website makes this search for the right information as easy and understandable as possible.
       So people read more superficial, don't assume that all the content will be read thoroughly. Moreover, there is a lot of distraction on web pages like moving banners and advertisements in the sidebar. That takes more effort to keep your attention when reading. More effort than, for example, reading a book or a manual on paper. Keep this in mind.
       Provides anchor points in the form of headings and links and support through consistent unambiguous navigation structure.
