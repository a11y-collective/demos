				<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br />
				Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br />
				All your life<br />
				You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>

				Take these sunken eyes and learn to see<br />
				All your life<br />
				You were only waiting for this moment to be free</p>
